                                Elle Christine is a singer-songwriter based out of Richmond, Virginia.
                                Her original musical creations, stories inspired by life events, connect with the general
                                human experience – love, loss, and overcoming hardship.
                                Vocals reminiscent of 90s female artists like Jewel and Alanis Morissette,
                                Elle Christine’s five-piece project has transformed simplistic acoustic indie-folk music
                                into a multifaceted sound integration – neo alternative indie-folk dipped in rock, groove, and soul.
                                This lyrically charged music will make you feel like tapping your feet.
